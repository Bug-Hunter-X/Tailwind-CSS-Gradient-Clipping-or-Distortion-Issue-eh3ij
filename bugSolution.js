```javascript
<div style="width: 300px; height: 150px;" class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
</div>
```
By explicitly setting the `width` and `height` using inline styles, we ensure the gradient has a defined area to render in, preventing clipping or distortion issues.  Alternatively, ensure that any parent containers have appropriate dimensions set to avoid unexpected clipping.
