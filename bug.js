```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's gradient utility classes. However, if the `...` contains other classes that affect the element's size or layout (e.g., `w-full`, `h-screen`, `p-4`), the gradient might not render correctly or as expected.  The gradient might be clipped or distorted depending on how the dimensions are set.
